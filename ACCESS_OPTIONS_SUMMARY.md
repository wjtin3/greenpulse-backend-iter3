# 🚀 Access Options for Out-of-Range Stops

## Feature Overview

When a user's origin or destination is **too far from public transport stops** (beyond 1.5km walking distance), the system now provides **intelligent alternative access options** to help them reach the nearest stop.

---

## ✨ What's Included

### Smart Transport Recommendations

The system analyzes the distance to the nearest stop and suggests the best ways to get there, ranking options by:
- **Cost** (prefer free/cheap options)
- **Carbon emissions** (prefer zero/low emissions)
- **Time** (prefer faster options)

### 5 Transport Modes Suggested

1. **🚶 Walking** (if 1.5-5km)
   - Time estimate
   - Free, zero emissions
   - Recommendation based on distance

2. **🚴 Cycling (own bike)** (if <10km)
   - Time estimate  
   - Free, zero emissions
   - "Healthy and eco-friendly"

3. **🚲 Bike Sharing** (BEAM, Neuron) (if <10km)
   - Time + finding bike time
   - ~RM2 flat rate
   - Zero emissions

4. **🚗 Grab/MyCar** (e-hailing) (always)
   - Time + booking wait
   - Estimated cost (RM5 base + RM1.8/km)
   - Shows carbon emissions

5. **🚕 Taxi** (always)
   - Time + waiting
   - Estimated cost (RM4 base + RM2/km)
   - Shows carbon emissions

## 🎨 UI Display

The test page (`public/transit-test.html`) beautifully displays these options with:

### Visual Cards for Each Option
- **Icon** (🚶🚴🚲🚗🚕)
- **Name** and description
- **Time, cost, and emissions** in pill format
- **Recommendation** note (e.g., "Quick and affordable")
- **Green highlight** for recommended option with "✓ RECOMMENDED" badge

### Example Display:
```
⚠️ No Routes Within Walking Distance

💡 Recommendation: Nearest stop is "PASAR SENI" (2.34km away). 
    Recommended: 🚲 Bike Sharing (14 min, ~RM2)

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Cost Estimates (MYR)

```javascript
// services/transitRoutingService.js

// Taxi: Base RM4 + RM2/km
const taxiCost = Math.max(4, Math.round(4 + (distanceKm * 2)));

// Grab: Base RM5 + RM1.8/km
const grabCost = Math.max(5, Math.round(5 + (distanceKm * 1.8)));

// Bike Sharing: Flat rate
const bikeSharingCost = 2;
```

### Speed Assumptions

```javascript
const walkingSpeed = 5;   // km/h
const cyclingSpeed = 15;  // km/h
const carAvgSpeed = 30;   // km/h in traffic
```

### Emission Factors

```javascript
const carEmissions = 0.171;  // kg CO₂/km
// Walking, cycling, bike-sharing = 0
```

### Distance Thresholds

- **Walking suggested**: 1.5-5km
- **Cycling suggested**: <10km
- **E-hailing/Taxi**: Always available

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Distance Check
```
User location → Find stops within 1.5km
├─ Found? → Proceed with routing
└─ Not found? → Find nearest within 5km → Generate access options
```

### 2. Option Generation
```javascript
generateAccessOptions(distanceKm, type, stopName) {
  // Calculate times for each mode
  // Calculate costs
  // Rank by: cost + (emissions × 10) + (time / 10)
  // Return sorted options
}
```

### 3. Best Option Selection
- Lowest score wins (prefers: free > cheap, zero-emission > low-emission, fast > slow)
- If free and zero-emission, highlight that
- Otherwise show cost

### 4. Display
- Browser console logs detailed debug info
- UI shows beautiful cards with all options
- Recommended option highlighted

---

## 📱 Mobile-Friendly

The access options display is:
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Touch-friendly cards
- ✅ Clear icons and colors
- ✅ Easy to scan quickly
- ✅ Shows practical info (time, cost, emissions)

---

## 🎯 Real-World Examples

### Scenario 1: Suburb (2km from nearest stop)
**Recommendation**: 🚲 Bike-sharing (14 min, RM2)
- Faster than walking (28 min)
- Cheaper than taxi (RM8)
- Zero emissions

### Scenario 2: Far Location (4km from nearest stop)
**Recommendation**: 🚗 Grab (13 min, RM12)
- Too far to cycle comfortably
- Much faster than walking (48 min)
- Still shows cycling as alternative

### Scenario 3: Just Beyond Walking (1.8km)
**Recommendation**: 🚴 Cycling (7 min, Free)
- Close enough to cycle easily
- Free and healthy
- Shows walking as option too (22 min)

---

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **User-Friendly**: Never leaves users stranded with "no routes found"
2. **Practical**: Shows real transport options with costs
3. **Eco-Conscious**: Highlights zero-emission options
4. **Cost-Aware**: Helps users make informed decisions
5. **Complete Journey**: Covers first/last-mile problem
6. **Local Context**: Uses Malaysian services (Grab, local bike-sharing)

---

## 🧪 Testing

To trigger the access options display:

1. Choose a location **2-4km from any stops**
2. Plan a route
3. You'll see:
   - Error message
   - Nearest stops list
   - **Access options cards** ← NEW!
   - Recommendation

### Console Output:
```javascript
❌ Transit route planning failed
Error: No stops within walking distance of origin (1.5km)
